# Number Prediction Project

This project predicts the next number in a sequence based on a given 3-number input using an artificial intelligence model. The model is built using an LSTM neural network and is integrated with a Flask web application to provide a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **LSTM-based AI model** for next number prediction.
- User-friendly web interface built with Flask.
- Simple JSON API for prediction services.
- Pre-trained on basic sequential data.
